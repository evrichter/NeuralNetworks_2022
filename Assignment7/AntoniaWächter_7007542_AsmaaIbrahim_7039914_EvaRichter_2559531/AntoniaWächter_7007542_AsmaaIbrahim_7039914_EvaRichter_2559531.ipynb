    "We see that when lambda = 0, $\\hat{y}$ is too close to y, indicating overfitting, which usually leads to undesirable generalisation difficulties on unseen data. To prevent this, the so-called L2/Ridge regression method introduces a \"bias\", which is our lambda multiplied by the squared slope. Accordingly, a big penalty (bias) is introduced when the squared slope is multiplied by a larger lambda value. If lambda is 0, as in the second plot, it means that the penalty is 0, i.e. only the sum of squared errors is minimised. However, if lambda is increased, $\\hat{y}$ shows less sensitivity towards the input x. On the other hand, if the bias is too large, this can lead to the other extreme, which is shown in the last plot for lambda = 1. Since in this case lambda is too large, the function does not capture the relationship between input and output variable well enough. To prevent this, lambda should be reduced, i.e. the bias should be reduced or more variance should be introduced. In this case, our lambda value of 0.001 seems to be a good try, as the function is neither overfitting nor underfitting and thus maintains a good balance between bias and variance."

    "- Dropout aims to avoid both the problem of overfitting (due to lack of data) and the problem of computational expensive computations. Lack of data is one of the main problems in machine learning that can lead, for example, to overfitting, i.e. the model adapts too much to the training data set so that generalisation to unseen test data is not possible. This could be prevented by regularising the models by averaging the predictions of all possible parameter settings and weighting each setting by the posterior probability implied in the training data. However, this requires an unmanageable amount of computing power. The dropout technique avoids both the problem of overfitting and computationally expensive calculations by randomly dropping out units in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dropout technique temporarily drops or removes certain neurons in the network during training, so that only a fraction of the weights is learned instead of all weights. Since after each iteration different neurons are kept and dropped out, this prevents that only few neurons influence the training process and therefore helps to reduce overfitting. For training with dropout a term $\\textit{r}$ is introduced which keeps the neuron turned on or turns it off by assigning 1 (turned on) or 0 (turned off) to it. Whether units are kept or dropped out depends on a probability that can be chosen using a validation set or just set to a probability value, usually 0.5.  The optimal probability for input units to be retained should, however, be closer to 1 than to 0. After applying dropout we end up with a “thinned” network, which consists of all the units that were kept after the dropout. For a network with $\\textit{n}$ units, there are in total $2^{n}$ possible thinned neural networks. Since for each training case a new thinned neural network is sampled and trained, dropout can be thought of as a collection of these $2^{n}$ thinned networks with shared weights, each of which gets trained rarely or never.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During inference, dropout should not be used because it is not feasible to average the predictions of many thinned models for test data. Instead, an approximate averaging method is often used, where a single neural network without dropout is used for testing. In this case, the weights of the units held at a certain probability $\\textit{p}$ during training are multiplied by this probability $\\textit{p}$ during testing to ensure equality of the expected output at the hidden units during training and the actual output during testing. In this way, we can combine $2^{n}$  nets with common weights into a single net used in testing. Using this method can in many cases help neural networks perform better on the test set due to a lower generalisation error compared to other regularisation methods.\n"
